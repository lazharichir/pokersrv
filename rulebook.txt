  UNIQUE POKER GAME RULEBOOK (ASCII VERSION) - REVISED
==============================================================================

This document outlines the complete rules for the Unique Poker Game.
Please read this carefully to understand the game mechanics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I. GAME SETUP
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. DECK:
     - A standard 52-card deck is used, with ranks from 2 to Ace (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2) and four suits (Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs). Suit ranking is not relevant in this game.

  2. PLAYERS PER TABLE:
     - Each table can accommodate multiple players (e.g., 2-8 players, to be configurable in your system).

  3. THE BUTTON (DEALER):
     - At the start of each game, a player is designated as the "Button" (Dealer).
     - The Button position rotates clockwise to the next active player after each hand.

  4. CHIPS/CURRENCY:
     - Players use chips or a virtual currency to participate in the game.
     - Define the Ante amount and minimum table buy-in as needed for your game economy.

  5. TABLE-SPECIFIC PARAMETERS:
     - The following parameters can be configured per table:
        i. Discard Phase Duration: Time allowed for discard decision (default: 3 seconds).
        ii. Discard Cost Type: Method to calculate discard cost (see section V.3).
        iii. Continuation Bet Multiplier: Multiple of Ante for Continuation Bet (e.g., 2x, 3x).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
II. GAMEPLAY - HAND FLOW (PER HAND)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  A. ANTE:
     - Before each hand begins, every player at the table must place a mandatory "Ante" bet into the pot.
     - The Ante amount is a predefined value for each table.

  B. HOLE CARDS:
     - Once Antes are collected, the Button (Dealer) deals TWO private "Hole Cards" face down to each player, starting with the player to the left of the Button and proceeding clockwise.

  C. CONTINUATION BET:
     - After receiving their Hole Cards, each player must choose to either:
        i. PAY the "Continuation Bet":  Pay an amount equal to the Continuation Bet Multiplier (defined per table) times the Ante. This amount is calculated as:  (Continuation Bet Multiplier) * Ante.
        ii. FOLD: Forfeit their hand and Ante. They are no longer part of this hand and lose their Ante.
     - Players decide in turn, starting with the player to the left of the Button.

  D. COMMUNITY CARDS DEAL (INITIAL):
     - After the Continuation Bet phase, the Button deals EIGHT "Community Cards" face up in the center of the table. These cards are shared by all players remaining in the hand.

  E. DISCARD PHASE (OPTIONAL):
     - Immediately after the 8 Community Cards are dealt, a "Discard Phase" begins.
     - DURATION:  Table-specific duration (default: 3 seconds).
     - ACTION: Each player has the option to discard ONE of the 8 Community Cards.
     - COST: Discarding a card has a table-specific cost (see Section V.3 for cost types). This cost is added to the pot.
     - PROCESS: Players, in turn (starting from left of Button), can choose to discard a community card.
     - If a player chooses NOT to discard or fails to select a card within the Discard Phase Duration, they take no action and the phase moves to the next player or ends.
     - Discarded cards are removed from play and are no longer available for selection.

  F. COMMUNITY CARD PHASE & CARD SELECTION:
     - Following the (optional) Discard Phase, the "Community Card Phase" begins.
     - DYNAMIC REVEAL:  The 8 (or fewer if cards were discarded) Community Cards are revealed in timed waves:
        i. WAVE 1 (T=0 seconds): The first THREE Community Cards are revealed immediately at the start of the phase.
        ii. WAVE 2 (T=5 seconds): Five seconds after Wave 1, the next THREE Community Cards are revealed.
        iii. WAVE 3 (T=8 seconds): Three seconds after Wave 2, the final TWO Community Cards are revealed.
     - SELECTION TIMER: Players have a total of 10 seconds from the start of Wave 1 to select their cards. The selection phase ends at T=10 seconds.
     - CARD SELECTION: Each player MUST choose exactly THREE cards from the Community Cards to form their 5-card hand (using their 2 Hole Cards and 3 selected Community Cards).
     - LOCK-IN: Once a Community Card is selected, it is locked in. Players CANNOT unselect or change their selection.
     - TIME LIMIT: If a player fails to select 3 cards within the 10-second timer, the system will RANDOMLY select 3 Community Cards for them to complete their hand.
     - Selection happens simultaneously for all players during the 10-second window.

  G. HAND REVEAL:
     - After the 10-second selection timer ends, all players who are still in the hand reveal their 5-card hands (2 Hole Cards + 3 Selected Community Cards).

  H. HAND EVALUATION & WINNER(S):
     - The best 5-card poker hand among all players still in the hand wins the pot.
     - HAND RANKINGS (from highest to lowest - standard poker rankings):
        1. Royal Flush (10, J, Q, K, A of the same suit)
        2. Straight Flush (5 consecutive ranks of the same suit)
        3. 4 of a Kind (4 cards of the same rank)
        4. Full House (3 cards of one rank and 2 cards of another rank)
        5. Flush (5 cards of the same suit, not in sequence)
        6. Straight (5 cards in sequence, not of the same suit)
        7. 3 of a Kind (3 cards of the same rank)
        8. Two Pair (2 cards of one rank and 2 cards of another rank)
        9. One Pair (2 cards of the same rank)
        10. High Card (No pair or better)
     - Compare each player's best 5-card hand using these rankings to determine the winner(s).

  I. PAYOUT DISTRIBUTION:
     - The pot is distributed based on hand rankings as follows:
        i. 1st Best Hand: Receives 80% of the total pot.
        ii. 2nd Best Hand: Receives 20% of the total pot.

  J. DRAW RESOLUTION (TIE-BREAKERS):
     - In case of a tie in hand rank between two or more players, the following tie-breaker rules are applied in order:
        i. KICKER CARDS: Compare the "kicker" cards in the hands (the cards not involved in making the hand rank) to determine the higher hand.
        ii. HIGHEST HOLE CARD: If hands are still tied after kicker comparison, the player with the highest ranked SINGLE Hole Card among the tied players is declared the winner.
        iii. If STILL TIED (extremely rare): The pot is split evenly between the tied players for the winning positions (1st and/or 2nd place).

  K. BUTTON MOVEMENT:
     - After a hand is completed and payouts are distributed, the Button moves clockwise to the next active player at the table.

  L. NEW HAND:
     - The next hand begins with step A (Ante) and continues until payout.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
III. BETTING RULES (DETAILED)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  1. ANTE AMOUNT:
     - The Ante amount is a fixed value determined by the table stakes.  Example: 1 chip, 10 chips, etc.

        i. CONTINUE (PAY): Pay the Continuation Bet amount to remain in the hand.
        ii. FOLD: Forfeit their hand and lose their Ante.

  4. CONSEQUENCES OF FOLDING:
     - A player who folds forfeits their Ante and is no longer involved in the current hand. They cannot win any part of the pot.
